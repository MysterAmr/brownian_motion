# RandomWalk

This program reads points from a file and uses them to generate a path of a moleculre in 3-space (each point has three coordinates). In particular, this program simulates a random walk in the context of Brownian motion. First, I use the pandas module to read the points from a CSV file into a database. The database is then converted into an array using the numpy module. I then choose a random point from the array for the molecule to visit. When the molecule arrives at the endpoint, its path is plotted onto a three-dimensional graph. Since the random walker is likely to revisit certain points, I keep track of revisitations by scaling the markers of each visited point to its reoccurrences; in other words, the more a point has been revisited, the larger its marker will be.
